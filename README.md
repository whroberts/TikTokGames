# TikTokGames

Currently in development, I am recreating the vast array of fake games that are advertised on TikTok. I know that people enjoy these minigames, and I want to create a version that is just those.

Using Unity and C#, I am creating a system of Object-Oriented Design that can be applied to create any number of games using the underlying system. 

My hope is to release this game on iOS, Android, and WebGL for free.
